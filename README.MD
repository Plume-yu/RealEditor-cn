### Installation & Usage

1. Download and extract the executable
2. Run it
3. Specify the S1Game folder
4. Press 'Associate' to open *.gpk files using Explorer
5. Hit Apply

From here you will be presented with an open dialog to select a package you want to view/edit.
Also, you don't need to start RE every time. After file association, you can double click a *.gpk file in the Explorer.

Guides and tutorials will be added as soon as I finish working on texture import and package save features
